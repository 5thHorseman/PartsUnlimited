Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

		@description = This liquid fuel booster system is a very purposeful piece of engineering. Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.
}

@PART[Size3AdvancedEngine]
{  
		@description = This engine is Kerbodyne's first attempt at a highly advanced engine. The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.
}

@PART[Size3EngineCluster]
{  
		@description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

		@description = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels. After docking, vessels can be just as easily undocked.
}

@PART[GrapplingDevice]
{  
		@description = Kerbal Motion engineers have long struggled with the problem of how to extract dropped tools from complicated machinery. After observing an intern cleaning out his shoes by turning them upside and shaking them inside the lab, our team was hit with a stroke of inspiration! Why not turn the rocket parts upside down and shake them? The grabbing arm perfectly filled this niche, and is quite capable of lifting heavy machinery. It has since found other uses, besides delicate tool extraction operations. AKA "The Klaw!"

@PART[ladder1]
{  
		@description = The Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer, known in some circles as a "ladder", is a state-of-the-art vertical mobility device, allowing your intrepid crew to scamper around the exterior of your ship like highly caffeinated rodents.
}

@PART[telescopicLadderBay]
{  
		@description = The Kelus-LV Mobility Enhancer Bay comes equipped with advanced telescopic extension technology. Recommended load 1.5 kerbals. After discovering that their name was already in use, Kelus picked their current name with the flip of a coin.
}

@PART[telescopicLadder]
{  
		@description = The Kelus Mobility Enhancer comes equipped with advanced telescopic extension technology. Recommended load 0.5 kerbals. After discovering that their name was already in use, Kelus picked their current name with the flip of a coin.
}

@PART[landingLeg1]
{  
		@description = It may have been originally designed as a heavy-duty metal detector, but this landing leg certainly emphasises an important fact in surface landings: you don't need to put a crater in the ground to stop yourself!
}

@PART[landingLeg1-2]
{  
		@description = The LT-2 Landing Strut offers a heavy-duty method for planting yourself firmly on the ground, without the severe consequences that usually accompany planting yourself firmly on the ground.
}

@PART[miniLandingLeg]
{  
		@description = A small landing leg designed for space probes or lightweight landers. Basically made of toothpicks... erm, Space-grade toothpicks mind you, but be careful with them anyway.
}

@PART[largeAdapter2]
{  
		@description = A shorter adapter from Rockomax, formed under similar circumstances to its big brother. Coated with spaceproof paint for maximum integrity.
}

@PART[largeAdapter]
{  
		@description = Governmental pressure and several lawsuits led Rockomax to finally consider creating an adapter to connect its own parts to that of its competitors. As much as the CEOs hated it, however, it was a resounding success.
}

@PART[launchClamp1]
{  
		@description = The TT18-A Stability Enhancer uses ground-breaking fastening technology to significantly increase the stability of spacecraft during the pre-launch phase. While OMB Demolition has been criticized in the past for using "big fancy words for a rocket holder" in their description of their device, none can say the TT18 series doesn't deliver rock-solid clamping action, as advertised. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.
}

@PART[LaunchEscapeSystem]
{  
		@description = This solid rocket tower is designed to wrench the command pod up and away from a malfunctioning rocket.
}

@PART[linearRcs]
{  
		@description = For every space that really needs an RCS thruster, Reaction Systems Ltd has you covered with its new Place-Anywhere 7 Linear RCS Port!
}

@PART[mk2CargoBayL]
{  
		@description = The longer version of the shorter cargo bay. Some ask us just how long is it? It's exactly double the length of the other one.
}

@PART[mk2CargoBayS]
{  
		@description = Ever wanted to deploy small items into space such as Cubesats, ion-powered Probes or Kerbals? This is just the part for you! (Disclaimer: C7 Aerospace does not condone the deployment of Kerbals into space via Cargo Bays.)
}

@PART[mk2CrewCabin]
{  
		@description = A Mk2 Profile Compliant, compact and eco-friendly crew transportation module, made from up to 80% recycled aircraft components. C7 Engineers insist that all recycled components were meticulously scrubbed clean before assembly, and take no responsibility for any odd smells that may be detected inside and/or around the unit.
}

@PART[mk2DockingPort]
{  
		@description = The new Clamp-O-Tron brand docking port comes complete with integrated monopropellant tanks for all your docking needs.
}

@PART[mk3CargoBayL]
{  
		@description = Originally we threw away the container the Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank came in, then one day a bright and upcoming engineer suggested we reuse them. He was promptly reallocated to another department and his boss came up with the brilliant idea of reusing these containers as cargo bays!
}

@PART[mk3CargoBayM]
{  
		@description = Originally we threw away the container the Rockomax X200-32 tank came in, then one day a bright and upcoming engineer suggested we reuse them. He was promptly reallocated to another department and his boss came up with the brilliant idea of reusing these containers as cargo bays!
}

@PART[mk3CargoRamp]
{  
		@description = A sophisticated deployment system for cargo delivery on the ground, or on the sea, or in mid-air, or in a vacuum. Wherever you want, really.
}

@PART[mk3CargoBayS]
{  
		@description = Originally we threw away the container the Rockomax X200-16 tank came in, then one day a bright and upcoming engineer suggested we reuse them. He was promptly reallocated to another department and his boss came up with the brilliant idea of reusing these containers as cargo bays!
}

@PART[radialDrogue]
{  
		@description = The Mk12-R is a half sized radial mount version of the Mk25. This "Drogue" parachute is small, deploys high up, and certainly not enough to stop you smashing into the ground on its own, but useful for slowing craft down before the deployment of your main chutes.
}

@PART[parachuteLarge]
{  
		@description = The Mk16-XL Parachute is a double-sized variant of the Mk16, now with only 50% of the structural integrity!
}

@PART[parachuteSingle]
{  
		@description = The Mk16 Parachute might be considered by some to be little more than a random stitching together of the surplus parts it is, in fact, made from. But the fact remains that the Mk16 has been widely accepted as a generally better alternative to being in freefall.
}

@PART[parachuteRadial]
{  
		@description = A parachute comparable to the Mk16 chute, but which is placed radially instead of attached on top of something.
}

@PART[parachuteDrogue]
{  
		@description = The Mk25 is what's known as a "Drogue" parachute - small, deploys high up, and certainly not enough to stop you smashing into the ground on its own, but useful for slowing heavy craft down before the deployment of your main chutes.
}

@PART[stackPoint1]
{  
		@description = Originally a defective Clamp-O-Tron docking port, engineers soon discovered it had great potential as a structural element.
}

@PART[RCSBlock]
{  
		@description = The recent discovery of a third law of physics made it possible for STEADLER Corps engineers to produce these small monopropellant thrusters, to help with attitude control and linear motion. Even though many Kerbal physicists still dispute the validity of this new law, studies show that the thrusters seem to work as advertised.
}

@PART[ServiceBay_125]
{  
		@description = A heat resistant service bay, ideal for protecting delicate instruments or stowing small service components such as RCS tanks, batteries, etc.
}

@PART[ServiceBay_250]
{  
		@description = A heat resistant service bay, ideal for protecting delicate instruments or stowing small service components such as RCS tanks, batteries, etc.
}

@PART[spotLight1]
{  
		@description = The Illuminator Mk1 from RKEA projects a strong beam of photons in its prograde direction, increasing the brightness of surfaces exposed to the beam (it's a big flashlight).
}

@PART[spotLight2]
{  
		@description = The Illuminator Mk2 is an extra-wide beam, low-power Illuminator, for lighting up large swaths of whatever you wish. However, its beam does not shine very far.
}

@PART[stackBiCoupler]
{  
		@description = The TVR-200 Stack Bi-Coupler is a simple method for splitting one rocket into two - WITHOUT the disastrous consequences of doing it the normal (explosive) way.
}

@PART[stackQuadCoupler]
{  
		@description = What could be more awesome than a Tricoupler? Why, a quadcoupler, of course. Just remember that this is not a decoupler, and will not separate stages.
}

@PART[stackTriCoupler]
{  
		@description = The Stack Tricoupler! If your stack is lacking in awesomeness, this is the tool for you! Just remember that this is not a decoupler, and won't separate stages.
}

@PART[GearLarge]
{  
		@description = Heavy-duty retractable landing gear. With it's six large tires and sturdy assembly it's the gear of choice for heavy cargo planes and airliners.
}

@PART[GearFixed]
{  
		@description = Simple wheel-on-a-stick Landing Gear to bring your birds down safely. (That means your airplanes, LightYear Co. does not encourage attempting to attach landing gear to actual birds)
}

@PART[GearFree]
{  
		@description = Simple wheel with steering actuation. It has become evident that aerodynamic control surfaces don't offer much control while slowly taxiing on the ground. Hopefully these wheels will reduce the number of low altitude low speed collisions with buildings. And Kerbals.
}

@PART[GearMedium]
{  
		@description = Heavy-duty retractable landing gear. With it's four large tires and sturdy assembly it's the gear of choice for heavy cargo planes and airliners.
}

@PART[GearSmall]
{  
		@description = High performance retractable landing gear. This bigger version features two large tires to support big and heavy planes. The longer assembly allows for improved ground clearance. //Comes with shock absorber, steering and a built-in spotlights.
}

@PART[SmallGearBay]
{  
		@description = High performance retractable landing gear. Comes with shock absorber, steering and a built-in spotlights. If we didn't tell you, you'd never know that most of those components were salvaged from scrapped machinery... oh.
}

@PART[roverWheel1]
{  
		@description = After years of outcry against the lack of proper powered wheels, a small startup company named Kerbal Motion was founded and delivered just what the public wanted - the RoveMax Model 1 powered rover wheel.
}

@PART[roverWheel2]
{  
		@description = Seeing an untapped market for a smaller design of rover wheel, Kerbal Motion quickly pounced upon this opportunity with the Model 2 - designed for robotic vehicles or smaller crewed vehicles.
}

@PART[wheelMed]
{  
		@description = The TR-2L is an extremely tough wheel made for mobilizing medium sized vehicles across a large variety of terrain. The extremely high traction tread ensures firm grip on any surface, providing reliability and reducing the chances of being used for high-speed tomfoolery.
}

@PART[roverWheel3]
{  
		@description = The RoveMax Model 3 was developed in total secrecy by Kerbal Motion's R&D team over the course of a year and a half. When it was finally revealed to the company's chairman, he stared in shock, screamed 'WHY', and subsequently dropped dead on the spot.
