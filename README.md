#Parts Unlimited v0.1
==============

#REQUIREMENTS:
- Contract Configurator (This is a set of configs for that mod, after all)
- Module Manager (but what doesn't these days?)

#COMPATIBILITY:
- This mod will hopefully be compatible with most if not all other part mods. I tested it quickly with KIS and it seems to work just fine.

#CHANGELOG:
- 0.1: First good release, missing only balancing of part costs, agency art, and descriptions. Any and all mods should be supported unless they add their own part categories (like Utilities, Pods, Aero, etc). This should be considered an ALPHA release. If you install this, expect bugs. If you uninstall it, expect odd results in your save games!

BUGS:
- None! I hope. Tell me if you find something.

TO DO:
- Balance part costs. Let me know if you think costs should be higher or lower, and I'll be testing this myself.
- Agency Art
- Better Contract Descriptions, to help you make sure you're picking the correct part. I don't know for a fact how much I can do with that.

LICENSE:
- CC share-alike. Anyone is free to do anything they like with Parts Unlimited, so long as they allow others to do the same.

THANKS:
- To nightingale. Not only for making Contract Configurator and making countless changes to it to accommodate my inane requests, but also for endless patience in helping me understand his frighteningly configurable mod.
